==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*operator-insert-introduction*

*operator-insert* are operators for inserting to head(or tail) of textobject.

Thiese operators work differently with character-wise, line-wise, block-wise
selection areas.

Character-wise~
These operators may work as you expect, that is, inserting text to head or
tail of selection areas.

Line-wise~
Inserting texts in front of the first non-whitespace characters or just after
the last character in the lines. If empty lines are included in the range,
texts are inserted to the beginnings of the lines.

Before:
>
	foo
		bar
	
	baz
<

After:
>
	(Insertion)foo
		(Insertion)bar
	(Insertion)
	(Insertion)baz
<

Block-wise~
Inserting texts almost as you expect, but do not insert to the lines shorter
than the current cursor column. Look the following example.

>
	foo
	bar
	
	baz
<

Select block-wise the second column and insert texts. Then you will get:
>
	f(Insertion)oo
	b(Insertion)ar
	
	b(Insertion)az
<
Since the third line is shorter than the head column of the selection, the
insertion is not inserted.



These behavior might not be different from all your expectations, but it is
useful enough |v_b_I| and |v_b_A| for the purpose, I guess.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that inserted texts can not include line-breaks. They will be removed
before inserting a text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The operators support |single-repeat| by dot |.| command. However the behavior
would not be what you want when you use it with |gn| and |gN|. In that case
try |<Plug>(gn-for-operator-insert-i)| and |<Plug>(gN-for-operator-insert-a)|,
they might be helpful. Please take a look |operator-insert-examples|.



Requirements:
- Vim 7 or later

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*operator-insert-mappings*

<Plug>(operator-insert-i)			*<Plug>(operator-insert-i)*
<Plug>(operator-insert-a)			*<Plug>(operator-insert-a)*
			These mappings are defined in Normal mode and Visual
			mode.

<Plug>(gn-for-operator-insert-i)	*<Plug>(gn-for-operator-insert-i)*
<Plug>(gN-for-operator-insert-a)	*<Plug>(gN-for-operator-insert-a)*
			These auxiliary mappings serve you alternative
			behaviors for |gn| and |gN| with the operators. See
			|operator-insert-examples|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMIZATION				*operator-insert-customization*

The completion in a insertion input~	*g:operator#insert#completefunc*
The operators have a simple buffer completion function in the input mode of
insertion. It gathers words consisting of more than three characters from
visible range of lines. If you do not need this function, then please set
|g:operator#insert#completefunc| as an empty string in your vimrc:
>
	let g:operator#insert#completefunc = ''
<

If you want to customize the completion, please see |:command-completion| and
|:command-completion-custom|.

The default value is "custom,operator#insert#complete_from_visible_lines".



					*g:operator#insert#textobj#open_fold*
Manage the behavior when the target textobject is inside foldings~
This option changes the behavior of auxiliary textobjects,
|<Plug>(gn-for-operator-insert-i)| and |<Plug>(gN-for-operator-insert-a)|,
when the target textobject is found in foldings. If the value is not zero,
opening foldings and show where is the target. If you do not prefer to move
the viewpoint before a execution of an action, set the value as 0 in your
vimrc.
>
	let g:operator#insert#textobj#open_fold = 0
<
Opened foldings are automatically closed if an action is cancelled.



					*g:operator#insert#dummycursor*
Change the highlight coloring of dummy cursors~
The operators put dummy cursors to highlight the positions which would be
inserted texts. You can change the coloring of the dummy cursors with this
option. If you set the name of an existing highlight group, then the coloring
is linked to that group.
>
	let g:operator#insert#dummycursor = 'Cursor'
<
Or you could pass the dictionary variable which contains the information for
highlight. It could have keys named as following highlight arguments. Other
keys would be ignored.

	term		|highlight-term|
	cterm		|highlight-cterm|
	ctermfg		|highlight-ctermfg|
	ctermbg		|highlight-ctermbg|
	gui		|highlight-gui|
	guifg		|highlight-guifg|
	guibg		|highlight-guibg|
	guisp		|highlight-guisp|

Their values should be correspondent attributes or colors, available
values are described at |syntax|. For example:
>
	let g:operator#insert#dummycursor = {
		\	'ctermfg': '15',
		\	'ctermbg': '0',
		\	'guifg': '#ffffff'
		\	'guibg': '#000000'
		\	}
<
If you do not prefer the dummy cursor highlighting, please set the value as
an empty string.
>
	let g:operator#insert#dummycursor = ''
<




==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*operator-insert-examples*

By default, no mapping is set, so you must map key like following at first.
nmap <Leader>i  <Plug>(operator-insert-i)
xmap <Leader>i  <Plug>(operator-insert-i)
nmap <Leader>a  <Plug>(operator-insert-a)
xmap <Leader>a  <Plug>(operator-insert-a)

If you want to use them with |gn| and |gN|, then strongly recommended to add
following settings.

nmap <Leader>ign <Plug>(operator-insert-i)<Plug>(gn-for-operator-insert-i)
nmap <Leader>agN <Plug>(operator-insert-a)<Plug>(gN-for-operator-insert-a)

or, if you do not care to overwrite them, just like this:

nmap gn <Plug>(gn-for-operator-insert-i)
nmap gN <Plug>(gN-for-operator-insert-a)

These mappings are safely replace the function of |gn| and |gN| as possible.

Because of the position of cursor after an action, these operators repeatedly
insert texts for the same target even when they are used with |gn| and |gN|.
For example, search a pattern "\w\+", then it matches with "foo" and "bar".
>
	" foo bar
<
Assuming that the cursor is on the beginning of the line, if a text is
inserted to the head with |gn|, then you get:
>
	" (Insertion)foo bar
<
At this moment the cursor is on the last character of the insertion, that is
")". Thus the next target of dot |.| repeat is also "foo" because it is the
closest searched word, never reaches to "bar" usually. However, if you would
apply above additional settings, you could skip "foo" only just after
inserting a text by these operators. Note that after moving cursor or edit
texts, dot |.| repeat works as same as usual.

After dot repeat:
>
	Without above settings
	" (Insertion)(Insertion)foo bar

	With above settings
	" (Insertion)foo (Insertion)bar
<

==============================================================================
BUGS						*operator-insert-bugs*

- Embedding the special keys <BS>, <C-h>, <C-w>, <C-d>, <C-t> is not
  prohibited. However it may cause some problem to the behaviors of the
  auxiliary textobjects.

- The dummy cursor function can not highlight empty lines.

- The dummy cursor might be displayed weird if there is an tab character or
  a multi-byte character.
